# Architecture Documentation 

This document describes the technical architecture of the NeuroWealth Vault contract, including storage layout, data structures, and integration patterns.

## Overview

The NeuroWealth Vault is a Soroban smart contract that implements a non-custodial yield vault on the Stellar blockchain. Users deposit USDC, and an AI agent automatically deploys those funds across various yield-generating protocols.

## Storage Layout

### Instance Storage

Instance storage is used for contract-wide configuration that is read frequently but changes infrequently.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `Agent` | Address | Authorized AI agent that can call rebalance() |
| `UsdcToken` | Address | USDC token contract address |
| `TotalDeposits` | i128 | Total USDC held in vault (excludes deployed yield) |
| `Paused` | bool | Emergency pause state |
| `Owner` | Address | Contract owner for administrative functions |
| `TvLCap` | i128 | Maximum total value locked |
| `UserDepositCap` | i128 | Maximum deposit per user |
| `Version` | u32 | Contract version for upgrade tracking |

### Persistent Storage

Persistent storage is used for per-user data that requires efficient access.

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `Balance(Address)` | i128 | Individual user USDC balance |

## DataKey Structure

```rust
pub enum DataKey {
    Balance(Address),      // user -> usdc balance
    TotalDeposits,        // total USDC in vault
    Agent,                // authorized AI agent address
    UsdcToken,            // USDC token contract address
    Paused,               // emergency pause state
    Owner,                // contract owner address
    TvLCap,               // maximum TVL
    UserDepositCap,       // per-user deposit limit
    Version,              // contract version
}
```

## Share Accounting Model

### Current Implementation (Phase 1)

The vault currently uses a simple 1:1 asset accounting model:

```
1 deposited USDC = 1 vault balance unit
```

This means:
- Users receive exact balance matching their deposit
- No share tokens are minted
- Yield is tracked separately by the AI agent off-chain

**Limitations**:
- Cannot accurately track user's share of yield earned
- No proportional withdrawal during yield deployment
- Not ERC-4626 compliant

### Future Implementation (Phase 2)

Will upgrade to proper share-based accounting:

```
shares = (assets * total_shares) / total_assets
assets = (shares * total_assets) / total_shares
```

This enables:
- Proportional claim on total vault assets
- Accurate yield distribution
- ERC-4626 compliance
- Proper rebalancing during withdrawals

## Rounding Rules

### Current Implementation

- Deposits: 1:1 (no rounding)
- Withdrawals: 1:1 (no rounding)
- Minimum deposit: 1 USDC (1,000,000 in 7-decimal units)

### Future Implementation (Phase 2)

- Deposits: Round down (favor vault, protect against dust)
- Withdrawals: Round down (favor vault, protect against reentrancy)
- Share minting: Round down

## Event Schema

### DepositEvent

```rust
struct DepositEvent {
    user: Address,    // User who made the deposit
    amount: i128,     // Amount in 7-decimal USDC units
}
```

**Topics**: `SymbolShort("deposit")`

### WithdrawEvent

```rust
struct WithdrawEvent {
    user: Address,    // User who made the withdrawal
    amount: i128,     // Amount in 7-decimal USDC units
}
```

**Topics**: `SymbolShort("withdraw")`

### RebalanceEvent

```rust
struct RebalanceEvent {
    strategy: Symbol,  // Target strategy (e.g., "conservative", "balanced", "growth")
    amount: i128,     // Amount being rebalanced (0 for full rebalance)
}
```

**Topics**: `SymbolShort("rebalance")`

### PauseEvent

```rust
struct PauseEvent {
    paused: bool,    // true = paused, false = unpaused
    caller: Address, // Who triggered the pause
}
```

**Topics**: `SymbolShort("pause")`

## Cross-Contract Integration Flow

### USDC Token Integration

```
Vault Contract → USDC Token Contract (via token::Client)
                  ↑
                  ├── transfer() - receive user funds
                  └── transfer() - return funds to user
```

**Integration Points**:
1. `deposit()`: Calls `token.transfer(user, vault, amount)`
2. `withdraw()`: Calls `token.transfer(vault, user, amount)`

**Assumptions**:
- USDC uses Stellar's Soroban Token interface
- 7 decimal places
- Standard token operations (transfer, balance, etc.)

### AI Agent Integration

```
AI Agent → Vault Contract
           ├── get_balance(user) - monitor positions
           ├── get_total_deposits() - monitor TVL
           └── rebalance(strategy) - signal strategy changes
           ↓
     DepositEvent / WithdrawEvent (via Soroban events)
```

**Event Flow**:
1. User calls `deposit()` or `withdraw()`
2. Contract emits corresponding event
3. AI agent monitors events via RPC/subscription
4. Agent responds by calling `rebalance()` or adjusting off-chain state

### Blend Protocol Integration (Phase 2)

```
Vault Contract → Blend Protocol Contract
                 ↑
                 ├── lend() - deposit USDC for yield
                 ├── redeem() - withdraw from lending
                 └── get_balance() - check yield earned
```

**Future Integration**:
- Phase 2 will add direct Blend protocol interactions
- Vault will call Blend's lending functions
- Yield earned will be tracked in total assets

1. AI agent evaluates market conditions
2. Agent calls `rebalance(strategy)` on vault
3. Vault verifies caller is agent
4. RebalanceEvent emitted
5. Agent proceeds to execute strategy via external protocols

## Upgrade Model

### Storage Preservation

When upgrading the contract, the following storage keys must be preserved:

- All `Balance(Address)` entries
- `TotalDeposits`
- `Agent`
- `UsdcToken`
- `Paused`
- `Owner`
- `TvLCap`
- `UserDepositCap`
- `Version` (incremented)

### Version History

| Version | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| 1 | Initial implementation with basic deposit/withdraw |
| 2 | (Planned) ERC-4626 share accounting |
| 3 | (Planned) Blend protocol integration |
| 4 | (Planned) Multi-asset support |

### Migration Considerations

When upgrading to share-based accounting (Phase 2):

1. Snapshot all user balances
2. Mint shares 1:1 to existing balances
3. Track total shares = total deposits
4. Future deposits/withdrawals use share math

## Error Handling

### Panic Messages

| Function | Panic Condition |
|----------|----------------|
| `initialize` | "Already initialized" |
| `deposit` | "Vault is paused", "Amount must be positive", "Minimum deposit is 1 USDC", "Exceeds user deposit cap", "Exceeds TVL cap" |
| `withdraw` | "Vault is paused", "Amount must be positive", "Insufficient balance" |
| `rebalance` | "Vault is paused" |
| `pause` | (requires owner auth) |
| `unpause` | "Vault is not paused" |

### Return Values

All read functions return the requested data or 0/default if not set.

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests

- Deposit with valid amount
- Deposit with minimum amount (boundary)
- Deposit exceeding cap (should fail)
- Withdraw with sufficient balance
- Withdraw exceeding balance (should fail)
- Pause/unpause by owner
- Pause by non-owner (should fail)

### Integration Tests

- Full deposit → rebalance → withdraw flow
- Multiple users depositing and withdrawing
- TVL cap enforcement
- User deposit cap enforcement
- Emergency pause during active deposits

## Gas Considerations

### Instance Storage Operations

- Read: ~1-2 gas units
- Write: ~2-3 gas units
- Use for: Configuration, totals, flags

### Persistent Storage Operations

- Read: ~1 gas unit
- Write: ~1-2 gas units
- Use for: User balances

### Optimization Strategies

1. Batch reads when possible
2. Use instance storage for frequently accessed globals
3. Use persistent storage for user-specific data

## Ledger Resource Baselines (Issue #203)

Measured in the Soroban simulator against `soroban-env-host 21.2.1` with the
MockBlendPool and TestToken test helpers.  Upper bounds used as soft regression
gates in `tests/test_budget.rs`.

| Operation | CPU instructions | Memory bytes |
|---|---|---|
| `deposit` | < 5 000 000 | < 300 000 |
| `withdraw` (no Blend) | < 5 000 000 | < 300 000 |
| `withdraw` (Blend pull) | < 15 000 000 | < 600 000 |
| `rebalance → blend` | < 15 000 000 | < 600 000 |
| `rebalance → none` | < 15 000 000 | < 600 000 |

Cross-contract operations (Blend supply/withdraw) cost roughly 3× a simple
deposit because each `invoke_contract` carries its own CPU and memory overhead.

## TotalDeposits vs TotalAssets Relationship (Issue #183)

Two separate values track vault accounting:

| Field | Updated by | Includes yield? | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TotalDeposits` | `deposit`, `withdraw` | No | Principal bookkeeping, reporting |
| `TotalAssets` | `deposit`, `withdraw`, `update_total_assets` | Yes | Share pricing, TVL cap guard |

**TVL cap check uses `TotalAssets`**: after yield accrual `TotalAssets` can
exceed `TotalDeposits`.  The cap must compare against `TotalAssets` to prevent
additional deposits from pushing total managed value past the intended limit.
Checking `TotalDeposits` instead would allow over-subscription once yield has
grown the vault past the cap.

Share price formula: `share_price = TotalAssets / TotalShares`.  All economic
quantities (user balance, redemption amount) derive from `TotalAssets`, not
`TotalDeposits`.

## expected_apy Validation (Issue #185)

`rebalance(protocol, expected_apy)` validates `0 ≤ expected_apy ≤ 10 000`
(basis points, where 10 000 = 100 %).  Values outside this range are rejected
with `vault: expected_apy out of range (0-10000 bps)`.

The field is **informational for indexers** — it is emitted in `RebalanceEvent`
but does not influence on-chain fund movement.  Off-chain consumers (AI agent,
dashboards) use it to audit that the expected yield reported at rebalance time
is plausible.

## Upgrade Safety (Issue #189)

`upgrade()` is gated by `require_not_paused()`.  During an incident the operator
pauses the vault to freeze user operations; the upgrade guard ensures that a
compromised or mistaken WASM upgrade cannot be pushed while the vault is in a
degraded state.  To upgrade: unpause → upgrade → re-pause if needed.
4. Minimize state changes in single transaction
