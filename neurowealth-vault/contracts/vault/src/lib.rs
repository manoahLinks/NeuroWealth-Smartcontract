//! # NeuroWealth Vault Contract
//!
//! An ERC-4626 inspired vault contract for the NeuroWealth AI-powered DeFi yield platform on Stellar.
//!
//! ## Architecture Overview
//!
//! This contract implements a non-custodial vault where users deposit USDC and an AI agent
//! automatically deploys those funds across various yield-generating protocols on the Stellar
//! blockchain. The vault maintains 1:1 parity between deposited assets and user balances.
//!
//! ## Share Accounting Model
//!
//! Currently, this implementation uses a simple 1:1 asset accounting model where:
//! - 1 deposited USDC = 1 vault share
//! - Withdrawals return the exact USDC amount deposited (plus any yield earned externally)
//!
//! In Phase 2, this will be upgraded to a proper share-based system using the ERC-4626
//! standard, where vault shares represent a proportional claim on total vault assets.
//!
//! ## Asset Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! Deposit Flow:
//! User → [USDC Token] → [Vault Contract] → [AI Agent monitors]
//!                      ↓
//!              Balance recorded per user
//!              DepositEvent emitted
//!
//! Rebalance Flow (AI Agent):
//! AI Agent → [Vault.rebalance()] → [External Protocols (Blend, DEX)]
//!                              ↓
//!                      RebalanceEvent emitted
//!
//! Withdraw Flow:
//! User → [Vault.withdraw()] → [Vault Contract] → [USDC Token] → User
//!         ↓
//! Balance updated
//! WithdrawEvent emitted
//! ```
//!
//! ## Storage Layout
//!
//! ### Instance Storage (Contract-Wide, Expensive to Read/Write)
//! - `Agent`: The authorized AI agent address that can call rebalance()
//! - `UsdcToken`: The USDC token contract address
//! - `TotalDeposits`: Total USDC held in vault (excluding yield deployed externally)
//! - `Paused`: Boolean flag for emergency pause state
//! - `Owner`: Contract owner address for administrative functions
//! - `TvlCap`: Maximum total value locked in the vault
//! - `UserDepositCap`: Maximum deposit per user
//! - `Version`: Contract version for upgrade tracking
//!
//! ### Persistent Storage (Per-User, Cheaper)
//! - `Balance(user)`: USDC balance for each user address
//!
//! ## Event Design Philosophy
//!
//! Events are emitted for all state-changing operations to enable:
//! - AI agent to detect deposits/withdrawals and react accordingly
//! - Frontend applications to track user balances in real-time
//! - External indexers to build transaction histories
//! - Security auditors to verify contract behavior
//!
//! ## Upgrade Model
//!
//! This contract supports upgradeability through Soroban's built-in contract upgrade
//! mechanism. The owner can upgrade the contract code while preserving storage state.
//! Upgrades must be performed carefully to maintain:
//! - User balances
//! - Total deposits
//! - Agent and owner addresses
//! - Configuration parameters
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## Deposit USDC
//! ```ignore
//! let token_client = token::Client::new(&env, &usdc_token);
//! token_client.transfer(&user, &vault_address, &amount);
//! vault_client.deposit(&user, &amount);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Withdraw USDC
//! ```ignore
//! vault_client.withdraw(&user, &amount);
//! ```

The vault contract currently emits events for deposit and withdraw but several state-changing admin functions emit nothing. The AI agent and any external indexers need these events to maintain accurate state without polling the chain constantly.

Missing Events
Function | Event Needed -- | -- initialize | VaultInitializedEvent pause | VaultPausedEvent unpause | VaultUnpausedEvent emergency_pause | EmergencyPausedEvent set_limits | LimitsUpdatedEvent update_agent | AgentUpdatedEvent update_total_assets | AssetsUpdatedEvent rebalance | RebalanceEvent (update existing)
Expected Event Structs
rust
#[contracttype]
pub struct VaultInitializedEvent {
    pub agent: Address,
    pub usdc_token: Address,
    pub tvl_cap: i128,
}

#[contracttype]
pub struct AgentUpdatedEvent {
    pub old_agent: Address,
    pub new_agent: Address,
}

#[contracttype]
pub struct LimitsUpdatedEvent {
    pub old_min: i128,
    pub new_min: i128,
    pub old_max: i128,
    pub new_max: i128,

#[contracttype]
pub struct RebalanceEvent {
    pub protocol: Symbol,
    pub expected_apy: i128, // in basis points e.g. 850 = 8.5%

Tasks
Define all missing event structs listed above
Add env.events().publish(...) to each function that is missing one
Ensure all event structs use #[contracttype] derive
Write tests that assert each event is emitted correctly using env.events().all()
Acceptance Criteria
Every state-changing function emits at least one event
Event data contains enough fields to reconstruct state changes off-chain
Tests verify event emission for each function
